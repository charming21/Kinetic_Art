Program 1:
Our Algorithm takes in user input for quantity of: squares, circles, triangles, and rectangles. Once it is decided, the shapes will be drawn randomly throughout the grid. 
In addition, user can interact with our drawing with a mouse click. Clicking on the grid will draw a random shape with a random color, in that square. 

On the Technical/Programming description: 
Our Algorithm has multiple helper methods to help with drawing the shapes, the color for the shapes and the location of the shape. 
For drawing of the shape, be it triangle, circle, square or rectangle, they all take in x or y cordinates from the grid. To get the size of the shape to fit correctly in a square.


Program 2: 
What data did we use: We used the weather forecast from January 24 - 31, 2024. 
In particular the hourly temperature and the time.

How did we use the data: We followed inspiration from a networking drawing. Based off the multiple connections each network might have. Using the concept of connection, our drawing is connected by time. We created a spiral that goes outwards based off time, with center being the present time and the farther you go from the center is the future prediction of the weather. Each circle size is based on the forecasted temperature and the circle's color is based off the time of day.
